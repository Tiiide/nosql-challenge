Homework for Module 12 - NoSQL

In this challenge, we are provided with a json array that is used to populate a Mongo database.

Using the structured mongoimport query, the json can be used to create a new "uk_food" database populated with data.

In the Setup notebook, we set up our database from the json array, and perform operations to add/update/delete documents.

In the Analysis notebook, we perform mongo queries to explore the data.
